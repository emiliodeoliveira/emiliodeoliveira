# Hey folks

I'm Emilio de Oliveira, a Software developer with over 22 years of experience in the IT field. 

# üöÄ About me

Since I was a child, I have always been interested in technology. My first computer course was in a country town when I was ten years old. <BR>

In addition to computers, I am constantly involved with music and electronics, two of my hobbies. At the end of 2017, I decided to leave the technical support area and focus full-time on software development. <BR>

I always created some solutions, whether automation or communication, during my time at companies, which made me realize that this brought more value to companies.<BR>

While at Dell Technologies, I developed and registered a patent in the USA. I specialize in Java, Python, Oracle database, and software troubleshooting.<BR>

Among my professional characteristics are dedication, a holistic approach to problem-solving, ease of learning new techniques, and interaction with the group to share knowledge.<BR>
